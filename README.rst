Introduction
============

pgtune takes the wimpy default postgresql.conf and expands the database 
server to be as powerful as the hardware it's being deployed on.

Installation/Usage
==================

Source installation
-------------------

There is no need to build/compile pgtune, it is a Python script.
Extracting the tarball to a convenient location is sufficient.
Note that you will need the multiple
pg_settings-<version>_<architecture> files included with the
program too, pgtune can't work without those.

RPM Installation
----------------

The RPM package installs:

 * The pgtune binary under/usr/bin
 * Documents in /usr/share/doc/pgtune-$version
 * Setting files in /usr/share/pgtune

Using pgtune
============

pgtune works by taking an existing postgresql.conf file as an input,
making changes to it based on the amount of RAM in your server and
suggested workload, and output a new file.

Here's a sample usage::

  pgtune -i $PGDATA/postgresql.conf -o $PGDATA/postgresql.conf.pgtune

pgtune --help will give you additional usage information.  These
are the some of the parameters:

 * -i or --input-config : Specifies the current postgresql.conf file.

 * -o or --output-config : Specifies the file name for the new 
   postgresql.conf file.

 * -M or --memory: Use this parameter to specify total system memory. If 
   not specified, pgtune will attempt to detect memory size.
 
 * -m or --memory_percentile: Use this parameter to specify the percentile of
   system memeory to be used.

 * -T or --type : Specifies database type. Valid options are:
   DW, OLTP, Web, Mixed, Desktop

 * -P or --platform : Specifies platform, defaults to the platform running
   the program.  Valid options are Windows, Linux, and Darwin (Mac OS X).

 * -c or --connections: Specifies number of maximum connections expected.
   If not specified, it depends on database type.

 * -D or --debug : Enables debugging mode. 

 * -S or --settings: Directory where settings data files are located at.
   Defaults to the directory where the script is being run from.  The
   RPM package includes a patch to use the correct location these
   files were installed into.

Check the code in pgtune python script to see all options.

FINCAD Setup
====

Here is a typical usage for an initial FINCAD setup including enabling logging:

  python pgtune -V 9.5 -T OLTP -c 100 -L True -i $PGDATA/postgresql.conf -o $PGDATA/postgresql.conf.9.5-with_logging

If logging is not required then remove the "-L True" command line option.


Todo
====

A TODO list is included in the tarball.  There are also some TODO
items marked in the source code itself.

Bugs
====

There aren't any known bugs, besides the cleanup areas mentioned
in the source code with TODO tags.  These shouldn't impact use of
the program.  If you find a bug, there is a tracker on the pgfoundry
page for pgtune listed below.

Documentation
=============

The documentation README.rst for pgtune is in ReST markup.  Tools
that operate on ReST can be used to make versions of it formatted
for other purposes, such as rst2html to make a HTML version.
